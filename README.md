# Long Pham's Personal Website

This is my personal project, built during my free time.

## Technologies

The site is built with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte/overview) and [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) as its meta framework. I have always enjoyed Svelte (at least v4 and lower, idk about v5 yet). I used [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) along with [Skeleton](https://skeleton.dev) to assist me in building a clean, simple and accessible UI. I used [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io/)'s database services to store persisted data as I find it super enjoyable to work with.

## Features

### Projects

I have a page to display all my projects. I suppose you can call it a portfolio but it's just a page full of projects boxes

### CV

I have my CV as a static file available [here](https://longph.dev/resume.pdf). Can be seen on the page as well.

### Blog

I don't have the habit of writing anything but it feels fun to publish random thoughts to the world sometimes. I have a frequently updated threads dedicated for LeetCode solutions as well. The thread can be found [here](https://longph.dev/blog/h9evcysg5kckd8c).
